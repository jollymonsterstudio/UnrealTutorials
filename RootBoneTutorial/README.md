### How to add root bones / motion or keep animations in place

Hey guys,

Today we are going to roll into the New Year by adding in root motion to our kick animations as well as convert them to stay in place rather than move the mesh on their own.

This will help clean up the crappy roundhouse kick animation we had in place at the end of our last tutorial.

Take a look and we will see you next time.
